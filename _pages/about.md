This is my old academic website, it features interesting projects I have completed over the years, but will not be actively updated.

I now offer consulting services in Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Robotics with a focus on tech start-ups. You can find my new website at [grizai.com](https://www.grizai.com) and contact me at [jonathan.grizou@grizai.com](mailto:jonathan.grizou@grizai.com).

For context, I have a PhD in Artificial Intelligence, published 40+ scientific papers, and received national awards for my work. I taught AI, Robotics, and design thinking at various Universities, co-founded two start-ups, and worked in world-leading institutions. My interdisciplinary experiences and application mindset allow me to adapt quickly to various industries.
